# Troubleshooting Pull Request Problems

Note: if thereâ€™s a conflicting commit in the history of your master branch, you
can destroy your branch and replace it with a fresh copy using the command  

`git checkout -B master upstream/master`.  

To make sure your commit goes in at the top of everything else on the upstream
repo, rebase: 

`git rebase upstream/master`  

If there are conflicts, open the file and look for the diff markers, resolve, and continue.

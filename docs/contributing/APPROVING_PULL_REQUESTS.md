# WeVote Process for Approving Pull Requests
We have a team of engineers who can approve pull requests for WebApp (Nick Fiorini, Rob Simpson, Lisa Cho, Dale McGrew). A few notes about our process:

* Give thumbs up before approving to confirm that you followed this verification process.
* Provide general comments and line comments wherever relevant.
* Try to avoid stopping pull requests if the problems identified are minor, and can be improved through an iteration.
* If the changes are significant and may include breaking changes, the pull-request approver should pull the pull request to their local machine and verify that functionality isnâ€™t broken.

# Bringing a Pull Request to your Local Machine for Verification
Add the contributor's repository as a remote repo. Here are the core contributors:

    git remote add pertrai1 https://github.com/pertrai1/WebApp
    git fetch pertrai1
    git remote add nf071590 https://github.com/nf071590/WebApp
    git fetch nf071590
    git remote add lisamcho https://github.com/lisamcho/WebApp
    git fetch lisamcho
    git remote add dalemcgrew https://github.com/dalemcgrew/WebApp
    git fetch dalemcgrew
    Find the branch that the person is submitting:
    git branch -a
    

If you are wanting to test a PR on your local machine, make sure you have already done a `fetch` on the 
users repo. If you want to see if you have done so, you can do so by `git branch pertrai1 -a`. This will 
show you all of the branches for that user (from the example above for pertrai1). Now you can find the 
branch that is being worked on from the user and create a local branch based on that remote branch. Now 
you can do a `git pull <remote name> <remote branch name>` and it will put you into a local version of that 
users branch. Running `gulp` at this point will have you seeing what has been done for this PR and allow 
you to look at the code.

# We Vote Process for Approving Pull Requests
<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->

We have a team of engineers who can approve pull requests for WebApp (Nick Fiorini, Rob Simpson, Lisa Cho, Dale McGrew). A few notes about our process:

* Give thumbs up before approving to confirm that you followed this verification process.
* Provide general comments and line comments wherever relevant.
* Try to avoid stopping pull requests if the problems identified are minor, and can be improved through an iteration.
* If the changes are significant and may include breaking changes, the pull-request approver should pull the pull request to their local machine and verify that functionality isnâ€™t broken.

# Bringing a Pull Request to your Local Machine for Verification
Add the contributor's repository as a remote repo. Here are the core contributors:

    git remote add pertrai1 https://github.com/pertrai1/WebApp
    git fetch pertrai1
    git remote add pertrai1 https://github.com/nf071590/WebApp
    git fetch nf071590
    git remote add pertrai1 https://github.com/lisamcho/WebApp
    git fetch lisamcho
    git remote add pertrai1 https://github.com/dalemcgrew/WebApp
    git fetch dalemcgrew
    Find the branch that the person is submitting:
    git branch -a

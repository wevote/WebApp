# Pull Request Tips & Tricks


To make sure your commit goes in at the top of everything else on the upstream
repo, rebase: `git rebase upstream/master`  

If there are conflicts, open the file and look for the diff markers, resolve, and continue.

Send your changes to your forked copy of the repo in the appropriate branch:
`git push -f origin doc-script-changes`.  

In the web client, go to your fork of the repo, and initiate a pull request by pushing the Pull Request button. Submit the pull request!

While the pull request is out for consideration:
Any new changes unrelated to this one should be on a brand new branch (`git
checkout -b some-new-thing`). Don't forget to check out the master branch first, otherwise you'll branch off of the current PR branch

If you want to make changes to your earlier commit in response to comments on
the pull request, you change back to the branch that you submitted it from (`git
checkout doc-script-changes`), make any changes, then commit and push them (steps 6-9). These get automatically added to your pull request since they're in the same branch.

If your changes are small fixes, they should not be a new commit. Instead, use
git add and then `git commit --amend` to fix up your original commit. 

If you decide to abandon a pull request, you can CLOSE the issue it created and ignore it.  

If the pull request is good, there's nothing else for you to do, besides wait for someone to accept it. 

Once the pull request is accepted (or closed) you can delete your branch from the client. Or, you can wait until you have collected a bunch of them and delete all of the obsolete ones in one go.

Also keep in mind that `git branch -D my-branch` deletes branches only locally, to delete them from the remote repo you have to do `git push origin :my-branch`

Moving a change between branches
Sometimes you make a change on the wrong branch. You can move it to the right branch with git stash. From the branch where you made the changes:
`git stash`
`git checkout branch-you-want-it-on`
`git stash pop`


## Some useful tips and tricks

Modify your github client to pull in all the PRs and work on them
You can set up your github client to make it easy to work with submitted pull requests.

Edit your .git/config and add the two fetch lines shown below under remote “upstream”:
[remote "upstream"]
        url = git@github.com:wevote/WebApp.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
        fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/* 

Now, when you fetch upstream, you’ll get references to a bunch of PRs.
check one out with `git checkout upstream/pr/3328` for example  
from detached head mode, create a branch with `git branch BRANCHNAME`
fetch upstream, rebase against master, test things out. 
push to your branch to verify that CI tests are green for these changes.

when everything is green and looks legit: 
`git push upstream BRANCHNAME:master`
Pull in a specific PR for testing

Drop commits from a PR
In the branch where you created the commits you want to drop:
`$ git rebase -i upstream/master`

This opens an editor. Delete the lines you don’t want. Then:
	$ git push -f origin branchname
Pretty colors and branch name in your command line prompt
Add something like this to your .bashrc
source ~/.bash_colors




## Git completion
`source $PATH_TO_GIT_CORE/git-completion.bash`  
`source $PATH_TO_GIT_CORE/git-prompt.sh`

## Prompt
`export
PS1="\[$Green\]\t\[$Red\]:\[$Yellow\]\W\[\033[m\]\[$Blue\]\$(__git_ps1)\[$White\]\$
"`
And create a file .bash_colors.

### How to get a change from someone’s repository into your repo before it’s pushed to master
Define a remote for their github repo, e.g. 
`git remote add pertrai1 https://github.com/pertrai1/WebApp.git`

Now fetch their changes and rebase on top of the branch they have that change in:
`git fetch pertrai1`
`git rebase pertrai1/pertrai1_branchname`

If there are collisions, these files are removed from your git commit. Hunt them down by searching for seven > characters ‘>>>>>>>’ in your project. Resolve any conflicts in your editor. git status will also show the affected files (in red, since they’re not part of a commit)

Add the files back into tracking with `git add .`

Carry on with the rebase: `git rebase --continue`

### How to get rid of garbage files that shouldn’t be in git

Sometimes my Mac makes .DS_Store files in my git directories and I want to get rid of them:

`$ git status` - check that you don’t have anything important that should be added first!
`$ git clean . -f`

Caution -- if you have any new files that aren’t under git control, this will remove all of them.

## Things to never ever do (or at least try to avoid)

Especially if you have commit access to an Angular repository

1.don't make changes directly to develop or master, always start a new branch.  
2.don’t merge. It messes up the commit history.  
3.don’t pull upstream without a rebase (see above). git fetch and then rebase
  instead (or equivalently, `git pull upstream master --rebase`).   
4.don’t use `git commit -a`. You could silently commit something regrettable. Use -p instead.

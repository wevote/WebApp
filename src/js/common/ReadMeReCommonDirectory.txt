July 14, 2021:

The files in the common directory must be exactly the same in both the WeVote WebApp repository
and the WeVote Campaigns project.

In this way we will only fix a bug once, or make an added feature once, at the cost of having to test twice.

Please diff the two directories, and make any necessary changes to repositories asap, at least in the same day.

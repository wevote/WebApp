        <h2><b>Limited Use additional explanation</b></h2>
        <div>
          While the full description of Google API Services User Data Policy is linked to above, we want to share four elements from the Limited Use requirements from Google:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Allowed Use:</strong>
              {' '}
              Developers are only allowed to use restricted scope data to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent from the requesting app&apos;s user interface. It should be clear to your users why and how you use the restricted scope data they&apos;ve chosen to share with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Allowed Transfer:</strong>
              {' '}
              Developers are only allowed to transfer restricted scope data to others if that transfer is (a) necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent from the requesting app&apos;s user interface, (b) to comply with applicable laws, or (c) a part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets of the developer. All other transfers or sales of user data are completely prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prohibited Advertising:</strong>
              {' '}
              Developers are never allowed to use or transfer restricted scope data to serve users advertisements. This includes personalized, re-targeted and interest-based advertising.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prohibited Human Interaction:</strong>
              {' '}
              Developers cannot allow humans to read restricted scope user data. For example, a developer with access to a user&apos;s data is not allowed to have one of its employees read through a user&apos;s email addresses. There are four limited exceptions to this rule: (a) the developer obtains a user&apos;s consent to read specific email addresses (for example, for tech support), (b) it&apos;s necessary for security purposes (for example, investigating abuse), (c) to comply with applicable laws, and (d) the developer aggregates and anonymizes the data and only uses it for internal operations (for example, reporting aggregate statistics in an internal dashboard).
            </li>
          </ol>

In some cases, those third-party vendors may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Site.

Some cookies are used to pre-populate forms for you so that on repeat visits to the Site you don&apos;t need to re-enter certain information.

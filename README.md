![We Vote USA](unclesamewevote.jpg)

This WebApp repository contains a Node/React/Flux Javascript application. Using data from
Google Civic API, Vote Smart, MapLight, TheUnitedStates.io and the Voting Information Project, we give voters a social way to interact with ballot data.

Interested in volunteering? [Starting presentation here](https://prezi.com/5v4drd74pt6n/we-vote-introduction-strategic-landscape/). Please also [read about our values](https://wevote.hackpad.com/Community-Rules-C0sn7DhZhDt) and [see our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

You can see our current wireframe mockup for a San Francisco ballot here:

And finally, our current live version is here: https://wevote.me
